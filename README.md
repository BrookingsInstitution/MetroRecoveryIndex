# Overview

Each indicator has a separate CSV, named using the following naming convention: Data source — Indicator. All data is aggregated at the metropolitan area level. 

Readers can view metro progress in two ways: impact from pre-crisis baseline, and trajectory over the most recent month. 

*Note:* Metropolitan areas are assigned to metro size classes based on population estimates from the 2018 1-year ASC. Some 53 metro areas with populations of 1 million or greater belong to the “Very Large” metro size class. Some 56 metro areas with populations between 500,000 and 1 million belong to the “Large” size class. Finally, some 83 metro areas with populations between 250,000 and 500,000 belong to the “Mid-sized” size class.
