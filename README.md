**Overview**
  
  Each indicator has a separate CSV, named using the following naming convention: _Data source_ — _Indicator_. All data is aggregated at the metropolitan area level.

Readers can view metro progress in two ways: impact from pre-crisis baseline, and trajectory over the most recent month.

Note: Metropolitan areas are assigned to metro size classes based on population estimates from the 2018 1-year ASC. Some 53 metro areas with populations of 1 million or greater belong to the &quot;Very Large&quot; metro size class. Some 56 metro areas with populations between 500,000 and 1 million belong to the &quot;Large&quot; size class. Finally, some 83 metro areas with populations between 250,000 and 500,000 belong to the &quot;Mid-sized&quot; size class.
